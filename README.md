# DAGESTAN: Directed Acyclic Graph Engine for Succinct Trusted Asynchronous Network - Consensus Engine

Powering Scalable Web3 Solutions on Setheum

Dagestan (DAGESTAN) is an asynchronous and Byzantine fault tolerant consensus protocol aimed at ordering arbitrary messages (transactions). It has been designed to continuously operate even in the harshest conditions: with no bounds on message-delivery delays and in the presence of malicious actors. This makes it an excellent fit for blockchain-related applications.

*Bult on AlephBFT Consensus protocol.*
